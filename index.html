          <div class="panel-body">
            When I was 19, I got my pilot license and after a few years, worked overseas for the United Nations. I was the Chief Pilot for the UN in <span class="places"> Afghanistan and Pakistan</span>. I later flew for the US Army as a contractor in <span class="places">Iraq</span>. I got an MBA, worked in corporate strategy for awhile, launched my own business with a friend, and for the last few years have been working as a Product Manager for software companies.

          <div class="panel-body">
            I joined the Epicodus evening class because I work as a Senior Product Manager for a software company in <span class="places">Seattle</span>. My team was tasked with launching a public API and I found I didn't know enough about programming to direct the engineers. It motivated me to learn some basic programming skills and so far I've really enjoyed it. I plan on taking additional courses after this intro class is complete.

          <h4>Monolord band project</h4>
          <p>This project had us construct a page about a band we enjoy. I developed a <em>strange obsession</em> with Swedish <strong>death metal</strong> because its loud and often has repetitive bass, both  which helps when I need to do work and concentrate. And the lyrics are essentially incomprehensible (since they are in Swedish and just guys screaming) so its not like I get distracted by the voices when I'm writing up code.</p>

            <h4>Cupcake shop project</h4>
            <p>This project asked us to create an advertisement for a cupcake shop. My partner and I decided to write up an announcement for a new shop in <strong>Enumclaw</strong>. As people who grew up in the region, we decided to poke a little fun at this small town near Mt. Ranier.</p>
