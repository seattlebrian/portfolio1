            I have had several "chapters" in my professional life. After college I learned to fly aircraft and after a few years, worked overseas for the United Nations. I was the Chief Pilot for the UN in Afghanistan and Pakistan. I later flew for the US Army as a contractor in Iraq. I got an MBA, worked in corporate strategy for awhile and for the last few years have been working as a Product Manager for software companies.

          <div class="panel-body">
            I joined the Epicodus evening class because I work as a Senior Product Manager for a software company in Seattle. My team was tasked with launching a public API and I found I didn't know enough about programming to direct the engineers. It motivated me to learn some basic programming skills and so far I've really enjoyed it. I plan on taking additional courses after this intro class is complete.
